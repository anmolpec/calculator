CALCULATOR-(13/08/2020)
Used grid to create calculator layouts. Handles calculations in mathematically correct order and chaining is possible. contains backspace feature. supports calculations with negative numbers( ie the - operator chained with other operators). supports decimals. clear, all clear included. 
follows 3 steps- takes input from user. checks the input character by charachter during input to avoid mathematically incorrect statements. takes the input string and devides it into parts by separating at operators. especially handles for double operators as in the case of operation with a negative number. finally evaluates the expression with an algorithm similar to pre-fix evaluation of mathematical expressions.
still to add:
overflow of digits off the screen/
brackets(very difficult)/
remembering all previous outputs before all clear and using them/
designing improvements.
